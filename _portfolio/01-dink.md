Dink is a financial app that helps users achieve spending goals by providing an intuitive drill-down menu for analysis down to the penny. With a modern, visually pleasing design, Dink makes managing finances fun and easy. Users can choose between a suggested timeline or create their own, and find all useful information at their fingertips. Dink also utilizes powerful AI to assist users in gaining control over their finances.

The inspiration for Dink came from the realization that rising food prices disproportionately impact low-income families and students. Our goal is to use visualization and data insights to empower these individuals to make more informed spending decisions and ultimately save money on their food expenses.

As a co-founder of Dink, I played a significant role in creating the app. I collaborated with my team to develop the machine learning tools and implement data insights and visualization. I contributed to the development process and worked on ongoing management and growth of the app. Additionally, I led the development of the transformer-based Bert model to automatically classify user purchases into various categories, eliminating the need for manual data entry. This allows for a seamless, automated data stream that improves overall financial management.
