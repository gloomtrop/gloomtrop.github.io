As a graduate student studying machine learning, I possess a deep passion for technology and all aspects of science. My love for music, health, and traveling to experience other cultures is matched by my commitment to tackling important issues such as climate change and social injustice. With my strong interest in AI and machine learning, I hope to make a meaningful impact in the future, using data and science to drive positive change.
